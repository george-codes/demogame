Simple tutorial example with Flutter and Flame


## Setup Flutter and Android Studio
Steps for installing flutter and Android Studio in a custom install location on Win64 System.
Once you have flutter and Android configured, you can create your flutter project and add in the Flame Game Engine.

### Install Flutter
1. Install VSCode
2. Install Flutter Extension
	1. Extension will install the SDK
	- Note I end up moving my flutter sdk into a different/common folder
3. Set System Var for flutter SDK bin in PATH
```cmd
# You can echo out in powershell and see flutter bin is in the path
C:\Users\george> $env:Path -split ';' | select-string "flutter"
C:\tools\flutter\bin
```
### Installed Android Studio
Initially I didn't install Android Studio, but I eventually did. I also I adjusted the install location outside of AppData.

1. Downloaded and installed Android Studio into C:\tools\Android\AndroidStudio
2. Install Android SDKs into a custom folder (vs AppData) into C:\tools\Android\SDK
3. Setup System Wide Env vars for Android
```ps1
C:\Users\george> $env:ANDROID_HOME
C:\tools\Android\SDK
```

4. Added in recommend paths for Android Tool Chain
```ps1
C:\Users\george> $env:Path -split ';' | select-string "Android"
C:\tools\Android\SDK\tools
C:\tools\Android\SDK\tools\bin
C:\tools\Android\SDK\platform-tools
```
5. You will also need to install Android Command Line tools, which is NOT installed by default.
	1. Open Up Android Studio
	2. Select More Actions
	3. SDK Manager
	4. SDK Tools
	5. Select/Check "Android SDK Command-line Tools "

### Configure Flutter with Custom Android Location

1. Because you have a custom location, tell flutter where Android SDK is now located:
```ps1
#custom android sdk location, will need to tell flutter
C:\Users\george\work\rnd>flutter config --android-sdk C:\tools\Android\SDK
Setting "android-sdk" value to "C:\tools\Android\SDK".
```

2. Reconfirm Android License Agreement for flutter
```ps1
#you will have to say yes about 5-7 time here
flutter doctor --android-licenses
```

3. Make sure flutter is all configured with android studio

```ps1
[C:\Users\george\work\gdev\flutter-games\otb> flutter doctor

### Examples - Getting Started
The basic flutter doesn't have collision and game loop mechanics but seem to have some basic stuff. Let's take a look.
There are some basic games you can set up, they have a gitrepo with examples.

Clone out the template projects from:
```ps1
C:\Users\george\work\gdev\flutter-games> git clone https://github.com/flutter/games.git
Cloning into 'games'...

```

## Flame Engine
Game engine built on flutter. This add game mechanics into your game such as collision detection, game loop, etc.
### References - Doc
Flame Engine Documentation - [[https://docs.flutter.dev/](<[https://flame-engine.org/](https://flame-engine.org/))>)](https://docs.flame-engine.org/latest/)

### Steps I did
1. Created flutter project (I used VSC Flutter plugin to create the project, you can do this via command line too)
2. Add the flame engine as a dependency to the project - flutter pub add flame
3. Flame expects a certain folder structure, make sure these are created  beforehand (dirs such as ./assets and ./lib/components)
4. Start building out your code, my example code is all with ./lib (this is from the tutorial)
5. Example of game play
